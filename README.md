This Simple Calculator Project using Python's Tkinter library aims to create a GUI-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /). The main components include the root window (root), an entry widget (entry) for input and output, and buttons for digits, operators, and special functions (C for clear, = for evaluation). The project handles button clicks using the click(event) function, which updates the entry field, clears input, or evaluates the expression. Error handling is implemented with a try-except block to display "Error" for invalid inputs. The layout and design are configured for ease of use, and the app is made interactive by binding button clicks to the click(event) function. Optional enhancements include adding keyboard support, advanced operations, or improving the UI design. This project provides a solid foundation for creating a functional calculator app with basic arithmetic and error handling in Tkinter.
